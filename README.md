# AA Times Project
- The main goal of this porject was to create the main webpage for an alleged newspaper, the App Academy Times. App academy is a fantastic bootcamp with many learning resources and challenges to develop. This project idea was taken from the App Academy Open website.

- It's coded only using CSS and HTML. There's a bit of JS too for some minimum interactivity but it still has to be implemented, since my main focus was only on following the wireframe provided and creating a nice looking interface.

- This project was challenging because of the very specific layout the wireframe provided. It uses a lot of CSS grid and flex/flexbox. 

## Project should look like in the following examples if you try to render it yourself:
